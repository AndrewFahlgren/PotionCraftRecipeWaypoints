# Recipe Waypoints
This is a Potion Craft mod to help with the managing of "waypoint" recipes.

See the location on the map of your saved "waypoint" recipes. These include any recipes with no effects and any recipes which are far away from their last gathered effect.

Easily figure out where your waypoint recipe will take you if you continue brewing from that recipe by using the Go to waypoint button in the recipe book.

Check the path you will be working with if you continue brewing from the recipe by hovering over the waypoint icon on the map. Never continue brewing a recipe just to find your path leads you strait into a wall again!

Toggle waypoint recipes on and off to ensure you are only seeing useful waypoints on the map:

## Installation

If you are not sure where your Potion Craft steam directory is you can find out by opening steam, going to your library, and right clicking on Potion Craft > Properties > Local Files > Browse.

- Download and install [BepInEx 5.x 64 bit](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest)
  - The contents of the BepInEx zip should be extracted to your PotionCraft steam directory.
  - If properly installed, you should see a `winhttp.dll` file and `BepInEx` folder alongside your `Potion Craft.exe`
- Download and install [Recipe Waypoints](https://github.com/AndrewFahlgren/PotionCraftRecipeWaypoints/releases/)
  - The contents of the RecipeWaypoints zip should be extracted to your PotionCraft steam directory.
  - If properly installed, you should have a `PotionCraftRecipeWaypoints.dll` file at `Potion Craft/BepInEx/plugins`
  

### Automatic installation with [r2modman mod manager](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)

r2modman makes it easy to install Recipe Waypoints although you will need to launch Potion Craft from the mod manager each time you play.

- Go to [Recipe Waypoints on Thunderstore](https://potion-craft.thunderstore.io/package/AndrewFahlgren/Recipe_Waypoints/) and press "Install with Mod Manager".


### Steam Deck Installation

## Other Mods

I am making a series of mods which make recipes easier to use. All of these mods are intended to be balanced and feel like part of the base game:

[Alchemy Machine Recipes](https://github.com/AndrewFahlgren/PotionCraftAlchemyMachineRecipes) - Enables the save recipe button when making things with the alchemy machine. Make legendary stones and salts with the click of a button!

[Pour Back In](https://github.com/AndrewFahlgren/PotionCraftPourBackIn) - Makes your potions work just like recipes. Pour potions back in the cauldron to continue where you left off. You can also finish potions before you add any effects so you can come back to them later just like a waypoint recipe.
